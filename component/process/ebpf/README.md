# Socket-owner BPF programs

On Linux, mihomo can look up the process behind a connection in BPF maps instead of searching
`/proc`. The maps also answer for connections whose socket has already closed, and, with
`-exec-paths`, for processes that have exited.

- `bpf/sockowner.c` holds cgroup programs that record the process that creates, connects or
  sends on each TCP/UDP socket. On a socket's first outgoing packet they publish that process ID
  and user ID in the `conn_owners` LRU map, keyed by network namespace, protocol, source
  address and source port.
- `bpf/execpath.c` holds LSM programs that record the executable of every process: when it
  executes a program, when it's forked (a copy of the parent's) and when it's freed. Running
  processes keep their record in task storage, `exec_tasks`; `exec_recent` keeps the latest
  records by process ID, including those of processes that have exited. Each record has the
  process's start time, so a reused process ID isn't mistaken for the owner. An iterator adds
  the processes that were already running. Only LSM hooks record, because the kernel skips a
  tracing program on a CPU where the same program was preempted, which would leave a forked
  process without a record.
- `loader/` is `mihomo-sockowner`, a separate Go module so that mihomo itself doesn't depend on
  cilium/ebpf. `mihomo-sockowner attach` loads the programs, attaches them to the root cgroup
  and pins the links in `/sys/fs/bpf/mihomo/links` and the map in
  `/sys/fs/bpf/mihomo/maps/conn_owners`, then exits. `mihomo-sockowner detach` removes the pins.
  It needs `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, plus `CAP_CHOWN` for `-reader-user` and
  `-reader-group`. With `-exec-paths` it also attaches the programs of `execpath.c` and pins
  their maps next to `conn_owners`. Those read kernel structures, relocated with the kernel's
  BTF, so they need `CAP_PERFMON` and a kernel with the BPF LSM active (`bpf` in
  `/sys/kernel/security/lsm`).
- mihomo opens the maps read-only with plain `bpf()` calls
  (`component/process/sockowner_linux.go`), at the path in `find-process-bpf-map`. It needs no
  capabilities for that where the maps' file permissions allow it. It finds a running process
  in `exec_tasks` through a pidfd, which needs no access to the process either. Without the
  exec-path maps it reads the owner's `/proc/<pid>/exe`, and it falls back to the netlink and
  `/proc` lookup when the maps are missing or don't know a connection.
  `find-process-bpf-only: true` turns both fallbacks off, so that mihomo needs no access to
  other processes at all.

## Building

```sh
cd loader
go generate   # needs clang, llvm-strip and the libbpf headers
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o mihomo-sockowner .
```

`go generate` rebuilds `sockowner_bpf*.o` and `execpath_bpf*.o`, which are committed so the
loader builds without clang. `go test` in `loader/` checks that the objects carry the programs
and the map layouts mihomo reads.

`component/process/sockowner_vm_test.go` compares the BPF lookup with the `/proc` lookup. It
needs the programs attached (with `-exec-paths` for the exec-path tests) and root:

```sh
go test -c -tags sockowner_vm -o process.test ./component/process/
sudo ./process.test -test.v -test.run 'SockOwner|ExecPath'
```
